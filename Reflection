For this project I used Github copilot to help generate the functions inside of the assignment. I triggered copilots by writing specific comments about all of the functions I wanted to accomplish. Copilot also suggested versions of the missing valueand invalid row handling logic after I started typing the function headers. The code that it generated gave me a good starting point for the rest of the project.
Although copilot produced some good things, I still had to manually do certain modifications to make sure that it matched up with the assignment requirments. Copilots draft for cleaning column names included overly complex string manipulation, so i simplified it to make it more readable. Another small change was renaming variables and adjusting formatting so that the functions matched the rest of the style.
  This assignment definitely taught me more about practical data cleaning. It also taught me how to effectively use copilot. I also realized that copilot is not always completly accurate so it is very important to understnad the logic in order to verify the results.
